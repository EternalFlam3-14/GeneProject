# GeneProject #

This Gene Project is a hobby brainchild born originally due to a hatred for punnett squares and the desire to trace alleles through multiple generations. It grew into a desire to emulate artificial selection through code (not IN code, I'm not doing AI code-writing-code), selecting and breeding in order to produce desired results. The program is built using C++ (using very intro level code), uses the G++ compiler, uses GLFW and Glad in order to provide platform-independent graphics for the user interface. This is my first program, my first c++ program, my first cross-platform program, etc, etc., so it's a massive learning experience for me.

### In order to run
 - Download app.exe
 - Unfortunately you might have a lot of Windows Defender errors. The more it's downloaded, the faster it'll go away I guess...
 - Run

### Code Information
- Uses G++ terminal code in order to compile (MinGW must be installed in the case of Windows)
- Currently uses a .bat (Windows Batch) shell script
- Uses a .exe file

### Completed:
- GLFW, Glad integrated (Graphics interface, in order to ty and fulfill the first role) (Like... 97% github.com/markfaction 's work. I just modified it as needed 'till it worked, then integrated it with what I had. So, yeah. Shout out to that guy.
  - Basic file structure built, including libraries for Glad, GLFW, and personal libraries
  - Window library, Generate library (contains the random allele sequence generator, the allele reader, and the phenotype transcriber)
  - Currently saves the phenotype to a .txt, can easily be altered to also include gene sequence
- Compiler has been based aroung G++ in order to fulfill the first role
- Genome simulation currently completed:
  - Randomly generate allele sequences, read and transcribe to gene sequences, and store phenotype sequences

### If you are interested in helping me with the project
- Any coders who can help debug and run the code successfully cross-platform
- Able to shrink C++ while still keeping it modular, legible & expandable
- Pretty much anyone who made it this far, is interested in assisting the project, and can find something in the To Do List that they want to do. (To Do List found in the Wiki)
You can find my information on GitHub.
